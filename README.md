## Grammar2JSON

A converter from a text based grammar representation to a JSON representation.

The JSON representation stems from the course [Machines and Computability](https://www.uantwerpen.be/en/study/programmes/all-programmes/bachelor-computer-science/study-programme/) taught by Els Laenens.

This program is intended to facilitate the generation of test files for the course. It is hosted using Github pages and can be found here: [https://tobias-wilfert.github.io/grammar2JSON/](https://tobias-wilfert.github.io/grammar2JSON/)
