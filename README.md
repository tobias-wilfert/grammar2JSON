# Grammar2JSON
A converter from a text based grammar representation to a JSON representation.

The JSON representation stems from the course 
[Machines and Computability](https://www.uantwerpen.be/en/study/programmes/all-programmes/bachelor-computer-science/study-programme/) 
thought by Els Laenens.

This program is intended to facilitate the generation of test files for the course. It is hosted using Github pages and can be found here:
